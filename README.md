# Semantic Nav

This is a dropdown nav with the following features:

1. Non-prescriptive. Does not force a particular look. Only offers core functionality.
1. No javascript. Or at least as little as possible
1. Responsive (works well on tablets and phones)
1. Arbitrary nesting depth. (ie: sub-sub-sub-sub menus are ok)
1. Clean and semantic HTML with as little extra cruft as possible
